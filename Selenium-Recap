1.Latest Selenium Version and Features

Latest version is 4.25.0 and chrome Devtools supports are available v129
previous Version is 4.24.0 ->

2. How do u launch browser in a particular dimension /whats the use of chromeOption?
we can use ChromeOptions Class to customize and configure chromeDriver session 
ChromeOptions helps us to perform various operations like opening chrome in headless browser,set browser Size

ChromeOptions opts = new ChromeOptions();
opts.addArguments("starts maximized");
opts.addArguments("window position= 1920,1080")

3.DesiredCapabalities

it is used to set the browser properties which include browser name , settings,version and platform
Syntax 
DesiredCapabalities obj = new DesiredCapabalities.chrome();
obj.setBrowsername("chrome")

4. Why Webdriver called as interface /what interface u are aware of ?
its a public interface beacuse it defines a set of methods 
WebDriver is an interface because it provides a blueprint for browser automation, allowing multiple browser drivers to implement its methods independently

✅ Defines a contract – It provides method names (get(), click(), findElement()), but doesn't implement them.
✅ Multiple browser support – Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc., implement WebDriver in their own way.
✅ Flexibility & Polymorphism – We can use WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); to switch browsers easily.

5. Methods webdriver interface provides?
.get .close .getWindowhandles .getTitle

6. How will u verify whether webpage has 404 or not ?

By Using getpageSource() we can verify the page launches correctly , Also we can use Assert 
Assert.assertTrue(driver.getPageSource().contains("404"));

7.where will u use FIndElements 
FindElements -> Returns a list of WebElements on webpage 
to verify the Broken Links we can use FindElements 

8. how does my Selenium test scripts interacts with Browser ?
By Using JSON Wire protocol my Selenium Test Scripts get communicated with Browser Drivers through real Browser Using HTTP Methods 
JSON Wire protocol is a RestFUl WebServices using JSON or HTTP 

9. Purpose of Waits in Selenium ?
SOmtimes a certain webelemt takes longer time to appear in that case our test might throw a NoSUCHException , TO Avoid that we use WAITS 
TYPES OF WAITS 

Implicit wait - > its a global Wait used in the Automation Framework which is used to set the  default wait time globally throughout the program which applies for all the webelements 
explicit wait -> Used to wait for particular instances only like -> waiting for visibility of web element, wait till an alert comes 
Fluent wait ->   its same as explicit wait but it comes with Polling time / interval time 

10. Asserts in Selenium ?
Its used to validate the actual and expected resus are same or not 
Syntax 

Assert.assertEquals(ExpectedText,webelement.getText());

11. Whats the Design pattern for your test scripting 

POM is a design pattern that helps creaate a object Repo for the Web Elements 
POM improves COde reusability and readability 
Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern used in Selenium automation to enhance code maintainability, reusability, and readability. It represents each web page as a separate class with locators and methods that interact with elements on that page.

13.How do you  scroll down to particular web element

we can use Javascript executor and Actions class 
JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//button[text()='Submit']"));
js.executeScript("arguments[0].scrollIntoView(true);", element);

WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("targetElement"));
Actions actions = new Actions(driver);
actions.moveToElement(element).perform();

14. How to Enter Text Without sendKeys() in Selenium?

JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
WebElement inputField = driver.findElement(By.id("username"));
js.executeScript("arguments[0].value='testuser';", inputField);

15.How to mouseHover a Element 

WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.xpath());
Actions action = new Actions(driver);
action.movetoelement(element).perform();

16.How to perfrom RightClick 
Actions action = new Actions(driver);
action.movetoelement(element).perform();
action.contextclick.perfrom();

17. how to extract Tooltip Value method
First of all inspect the element which provide tooltip, in title attribute only the value might be there , so we are getting the attribute by using getAttribute of that element which prints the tooltip value 
String tooltip = driver.FindElement(By.xpath().getAttribute("title"));
System.out.print(tooltip);
