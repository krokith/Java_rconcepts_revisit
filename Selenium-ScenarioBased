SSelenium Scenario Based Questions 
1. in ur project there can be 1000 Testcases, How do u choose Automation testcases ?
 Intially we autmate critical priority testcases p0 and make sure buisness critical functionalities are automated 
then we go for major Functionalities and automate those 
then FInally we choose UI Autoation 

Critical order -> critical High  Medium and Low 

2.   whats is your responbilities as Automation ENgineer ? 

Perfroming Frontend and Backend Automation for in Sprint user stories, existing regression testing 
Peer code review
Enhancing the tesing Framework 
we have integrated the Automation Framework with CI/CD pipelines so for every 24 hrs then Build runs automatically we check logs regualrly to ensure there are no errors
and i used to lead 3 members of team and helped them achieve their goals

3.Test process I follow 

we work in agile methodologies so twe ahve 2 to 3 week sprint
we automate in sprint and automate the user stories fro backlogs 
Before that we make sure the manual flows works as expected 
once the automation script is done we create a new branch and push the code for review 
Once the code review is successfull we create pull rquest and merge the changes to master 

4. Best pratices we follow while Using selenium / how do u d Code Optimization 

Maintain coding standards
code documentation
Follow design pricinciples like OOPs
Remove sleep commands 
Avoid code dulpication
ignore using implicit wait 


5. How do you choose Automation Framework ? there are different frameworks 

First we undestand the projecr requirements and we analyse the data they provide post that 
if they provide large amount of test data maintenance we would choose data driven Framweork 
in that we will import the datas into the framwework by Using apache POI and we test data 
or else if there is a buisness cum Technicl team collarbation means we would choose BDD frameworks 

6. Parallel execution 

First of all parallel execution can be done in Selenium grid and TestNG

Parallel execution in TestNG allows running multiple tests simultaneously, reducing execution time. It can be achieved using the TestNG XML configuration and DataProviders with parallel attributes.
 Best practice: Use parallel="methods" or parallel="classes" in testng.xml for faster execution. Combine with Selenium Grid for cross-browser testing!

7. WHy are we Using TestNG librariies ?
TestNG anoonations  will help u organize ur test cases and make more readable 
Helps in grouping and priotizing tests
SUppport parallel testing 

8. how will u achieve cross browser testing in Selenium ?

By importing TestNG libraries with our framework and Using paramteter annotaions we can pass the browser values to the test

AUTOMATION FRAMEWORK BASED QUESTION

1.What type of Framework u worked on and explain the components in ur Framework 

I have worked with Datadriven and BDD frameworks
i would the POM strcutrure design pattern for test scripting 
and for test data maintenance i ll import db FIles such as Excel,JSON by using apache POI and work on a Data driven Framework 
For test Reporting i ll choose TestNG report generates
for readability,separating test i ll choose testNG annotaions 
FOR VCS i ll use Git
For CI/CD i have integrated jenkins

2.how will u manage selenim mvn related dependices 
we added all the project related dependicies plugins in POm.xml
when we run the mvn project these will be automatically called

3. Why Webdrver is a Interface ?
WebDriver provides a common interface for different browser drivers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
This allows switching browsers easily without changing test scripts.

ðŸ”¥ Why is WebDriver an Interface in Selenium?
âœ” Flexibility â†’ Supports multiple browser drivers (ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver).
âœ” Polymorphism â†’ Single reference (WebDriver driver) can hold different implementations.
âœ” Loose Coupling â†’ Browser implementation changes donâ€™t affect the test script.


4. Interfaces available in my Framwework 
JavascriptExecutor
TakesScreenshot
Webdriver
Action
Logs

5.  Let's say in my Framework there are more than 1,000 test cases. But I want to only exaexecute  the login and Dashboard related testcases . So how does that result?will u do that 

If your Selenium Automation Framework has 1,000+ test cases but you only want to execute Login and Dashboard-related test cases, you can achieve this using TestNG Groups, XML file filtering, or annotations.

for eg 
public class LoginTests {
    @Test(groups = "Login")
    public void loginWithValidCredentials() {
        System.out.println("Login successful!");
    }

    @Test(groups = "Login")
    public void loginWithInvalidCredentials() {
        System.out.println("Login failed!");
    }
}

public class DashboardTests {
    @Test(groups = "Dashboard")
    public void verifyDashboardElements() {
        System.out.println("Dashboard loaded successfully!");
    }
}


6. WIthout using sendkeys how to type in textbox ?


        // Use JavaScript to type
        JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
        js.executeScript("arguments[0].value='Selenium WebDriver';", searchBox);

7. what are the SOftwares Required to perfrom Automation Testing ?

Step1 : Install Java in our machine and configure the javapath in our system -> so selenium recogines the java installed path 
Step2 : Install a IDE for coding : Eclipse IDE, IntelliJ 
Step3 : Install a Build Tool -> Maven
Step4 : in POM.xml configure the Selenium and TestNG jars and import the RestAssured libraries 
Step5 : Configure the Git 
Stpe 6 : create a CI/CD pipelines through Jenkins 

8. How will u automate Dropdowns ?
By Using Select class 
electByValue 
SelectByindex
SelectByVisibleText

9.  Whats the use of TestNG.xml ?
To run multiple test cases in a Single Execution we use testng.xml 
it helps to include the Test groups 
and parallel executio 

10. whats the use od @dataprovidr annotation?
ðŸ“Œ Purpose: Supplies multiple test data sets to a test method for parameterized testing.

@DataProvider(name = "loginData")
public Object[][] getData() {
    return new Object[][] { {"user1", "pass1"}, {"user2", "pass2"} };
}

@Test(dataProvider = "loginData")
public void testLogin(String user, String pass) {
    System.out.println("Testing login: " + user + " | " + pass);
}

11. Paramterization explained 

in a Selenium script instead of Hardcording in @test we can use paramteers  in test script 
create TestNG.xml File -> open it and <paramter name ="URL" value ="https://google.com"/>

instead of Hardcording, use @paramters({URL})

public void getTest(String appURL)
driver.get(URL);

================================================
12. @dataprovider 

@Test (dataProvider="dataSupplier")  // here we are giving the name of @dataprovider to the @Test
Run | Debug
public void sampleLoginTest (String username, String password) {
System.out.println("Logged in using "+username+" and "+password);
}
@DataProvider (name="dataSupplier")
public Object [] [] supplyDataMethod () {
Object[][] data = {{ "arun", "123"}, {"varun", "456"},{"tharun", "789"}};
return data;
}
